## Project

Personal website rebuild for willluft.com using plain HTML and CSS.

## Goals

- Rebuild the homepage first
- Keep the design clean, simple, and fast
- Learn by making small, understandable changes

## Constraints

- Plain HTML and CSS only
- No frameworks except what's already in the CSS files (graffiti.css and styles.css)
- No build tools
- Minimal JavaScript only if needed

## Working Style

- Propose a short plan before major changes
- Make small incremental edits
- Explain changes clearly
- Preserve the current design direction unless asked to change it

## Current Scope

- Single-page homepage only
- Hero card with name, short description, and social links
